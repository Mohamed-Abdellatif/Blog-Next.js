CSS styles the web - it's **the** most important stylesheet language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: #0056b3;
}
```
